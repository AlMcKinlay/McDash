# McDash
Dashboard for many things that I use

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn dev
```

Note that anything with cors needing disabled won't work like this, you'll need to build and install the extension to test that.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
